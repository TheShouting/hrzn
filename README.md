# hrzn API
A C++ header only utility library for managing vectors, grids, and other coordinates. I initially developed this library to support another personal project of mine. That project was called Horizon, which where the `hrzn` namespace came from.
The included Visual Studio project and main.cpp is not required. It is only present as minimal example and to make it easier to test out the API down the road.
